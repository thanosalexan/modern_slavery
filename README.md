In this assignment I tried to estimate the prevalence of modern slavery, as well as factors that can help with this prediction, through Machine Learning techniques using the data and the methods of the paper below:

Lavelle-Hill, R., Smith, G., Mazumder, A. et al. Machine learning methods for "wicked" problems: exploring the complex drivers of modern slavery. Humanities and Social Sciences Communications 8, 274 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00938-z
